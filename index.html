					<h2>The Digi Wallet App</h2>
					<p>Simple to setup</p>
					<p>The app is optimized to work perfectly on any device. Enjoy the feature rich app and keep track of your purchases.</p>

						Once you have a weeks worth of purchasing information stored on the app you can use the apps saving option. The saving option looks at all your expenditures and sees if you can make any savings. Bought 2 cups of coffee a day on the way to work? The app will analyze this information and recommend only one cup a day. You can also configure the app so that it is more ruthless, cutting out many things that are not required.
